        Hello! Welcome to my blog. I don't intend on making this a super frequent thing, but it might
        be fun to document any thoughts that could be useful for others. Today, I wanted to reflect on
        my PhD admissions cycle. Remember, this is inspired by my own experience, which you should not
        treat as gospel. Nonetheless, I hope it can be useful!
      </p>
      <p>
        First, a summary of my cycle. I applied to nine PhD programs. I was accepted to UCLA, NYU, and
        Michigan. I was waitlisted at Harvard and UPenn, before both were cut prematurely due to
        the Trump Administration funding cuts. I was interviewed at Berkeley, but was ultimately rejected, alongside
        Stanford, Princeton, and UChicago. Overall, 3 for 9, and 2.5 consolation prizes. Not bad!
      </p>
      <p>
        I ultimately committed to Michigan, which I am thrilled about. I will be the only student to matriculate
        at the Ford School to study the joint PhD in Public Policy and Political Science (shoutouts to Helen, the
        sole other admittee). In my (biased) opinion, it's the best department in the world to study climate politics and
        Southeast Asia.
      </p>
        I'll first outline what I perceive my own strengths to be. I'm fortunate to have worked with several established
        faculty, who I'm grateful were in my corner and were happy to write my letters. I have no doubt that the connections
        I made at UCLA were critical in my eventual acceptances. I highly encourage undergraduates to seek out research opportunities,
        even if unpaid, because the mentorship and training you will receive is priceless.
      <p>
        Following this, I suggest that undergraduates take PhD courses whenever possible. In my two years at UCLA, I took the first-year
        series in quantitative methods, which made for a stronger writing sample and a great quantitative signal on my transcript. It
        doesn't matter if you are the only undergraduate, which I was, you can probably just ask for an enrollment code and you'll probably
        get one. You'll likely have more luck in methods courses than substantive cores. The classes are genuinely very interesting!
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several things I could have improved about my application. The first, and most consequential, was the GRE. Please,
        please do not underestimate the GRE. I have a very strong background in coding, but my pure math training is weak, and if
        you are in a similar spot, you will need months of studying to score competitively on the quant section. Most political science
        programs require the GRE and, according to anecdotes, will select on this heavily early in the review process. Try Gregmat for
        both quant and verbal, which I credit with moving from a 159Q to 164Q in about a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, make sure you understand program-specific material requirements. For instance, keep track of writing sample page limits, and
        what the personal statement is actually asking for. I made a terrible mistake of not realizing Princeton's personal statement was
        thematically different than other schools until the application deadline, and it certainly showed. Make sure you've looked at every
        page of the form and keep this information handy!
