# Ideal Training Split + Progressive Overload Plan

## High-Level Goal
- Drop ~5% body fat over ~8–12 weeks
- Preserve and build lean mass
- Train aggressively but sustainably
- Machine-dominant, low skill risk
- 3–4 lifting days per week, ~60 min/session

---

## Weekly Structure (Default: 4 Days)

**Day 1 – Upper (Aggressive / Top-Set Day)**  
**Day 2 – Lower (Volume or Load Progression)**  
**Day 3 – Rest or Light Cardio / Steps**  
**Day 4 – Upper (Volume / Control Day)**  
**Day 5 – Lower (Controlled / Hypertrophy)**  
**Day 6–7 – Rest, steps, optional cardio**

If only 3 days available:
- Alternate Upper / Lower / Upper one week
- Lower / Upper / Lower the next

---

## Upper Day A – Aggressive (Top Set + Back-Off)

**Chest Press**
- 1×6–8 @ RPE 8.5–9 (top set)
- 2×8–12 @ 80–85% of top set

**Lat Pulldown**
- 3×8 @ working weight
- Last set optional AMRAP (form-limited)

**Seated Row**
- 3×10 @ challenging but repeatable load

**Rear Delt Fly**
- 3×12 @ strict control

**Arms (Optional)**
- Triceps OR Biceps: 2×10–12

---

## Upper Day B – Volume / Control

**Chest Press**
- 3×8–10 @ ~85–90% of recent top set

**Lat Pulldown**
- 3×8–10 @ same or −5 lb vs Day A

**Seated Row**
- 3×10–12 @ same load as prior week

**Shoulder Press**
- 2×8 @ conservative load (no failure)

**Rear Delt Fly**
- 3×12–15

**Arms (Optional)**
- 2×12 light pump work

---

## Lower Day A – Progressive (Load or Reps)

**Leg Press**
- 4×8–12 (pick ONE: add load OR add reps)

**Seated Leg Curl**
- 4×10 @ controlled tempo

**Leg Extension**
- 3×12 @ slow eccentric, no momentum

**Single-Leg Leg Press**
- 2×10 / leg @ 40–50% bilateral load

**Calves (Leg Press)**
- 3×15

**Abs**
- 3×8–10

---

## Lower Day B – Controlled / Hypertrophy

**Leg Press**
- 3×8 @ −5–10% vs Day A

**Seated Leg Curl**
- 3×12 @ same load

**Leg Extension**
- 3×15 light, slow

**Single-Leg Press**
- 2×12 / leg

**Calves**
- 3×15–20

**Abs**
- 3×10

## Progressive Overload Rules (Critical)

### Big Compounds (Chest Press, Leg Press, Pulldown)
- Increase **one variable at a time**
- Typical rate:
  - +5–10 lb every **1–2 weeks**, OR
  - +1–2 reps per set per week
- If reps drop >2 across sets → stay at that load next session

### Accessories (Rows, Delts, Curls, Triceps)
- Add reps first (up to top of range)
- Then add +5 lb
- Expect slower progression (every 2–3 weeks)

### Failure Rules
- Max **one near-failure set per workout**
- Never fail isolation lifts repeatedly
- If two lifts fail in one session → deload next session

---

## Cardio + Fat Loss Support

- Daily steps: 10–12k target
- Optional cardio: 2–3× / week
  - 25–40 min incline walk / bike
- Do cardio **after lifting or on rest days**

---

## Deload Strategy
Every 6–8 weeks OR when:
- Performance drops 2 sessions in a row
- Joint soreness accumulates
- Motivation tanks

**Deload =**
- −20–30% load
- Half the sets
- No failure

---

## Success Metrics
- Waist circumference ↓
- Strength stable or ↑
- Visual changes in 3–4 weeks
- 5% body fat drop in ~8–12 weeks

---

## One Rule to Remember
**Aggression is allowed — randomness is not.**
